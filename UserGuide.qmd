# Brief Introduction to the APP

Welcome to our Shiny App, designed as part of our response to the Mini-Challenge 2 of VAST Challenge 2023. We leveraged on data provided by NGO FishEye International to unveil the opaque operations of companies who might potentially be engaged in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing which is an increasingly pressing global issue.

Seafood, the world's largest traded food commodity, is a vital source of sustenance for over 3 billion people. Yet, it is estimated that 85% of fish stocks are either overfished or fully exploited. According to a study conducted by the Financial Transparency Coalition, it found that IUU fishing accounts for one-fifth of the global fisheries' catches (equivalent to approximately \$23.5bn) annually. Global losses arising from IUU fishing are also estimated to be approximately \$50bn.

As part of the VAST Challenge 2023, we have developed this app to analyze and gain a deeper understanding on the fishing industries' import/export data. The data, albeit incomplete, has been transformed into a knowledge graph to understand the complex business relationships as well as identify key patterns and suspicious companies to stop IUU fishing and protect the affected marine species.

Our Shiny App allows you to delve into this challenge dataset and detect potential illegal fishing activities. We employ visual analytics to identify temporal patterns, evaluate suggested links to complete the knowledge graph, and detect new patterns or anomalies post the addition of the identified reliable links.

## Application Features

As illustrated via the below diagram, this application has 3 key modules:

![](images/image2.png)

**Fishing Transaction Overview:** This module allows user to gain an overall understanding of the fishing related transactions and patterns. It includes statistics and interactive exploration tools on key attributes such as Countries (shipping and receiving), Transactions, Shipping Variables (Volume -- TEU, Weight - Kg etc), HSCODES and HS Categories, as well as temporal changes in activities.

1)  **Fishing Transaction Network:** This module provides insights and visualisations in the form of a network graph. It allows the user to interactively explore relationships between nodes and its associated edge connections.
2)  **Bundles Network:** This module helps user compare and investigate the usability of the various bundles. You can evaluate the reliability of different bundle set with the predicted knowledge graph links provided by FishEye. Using visual analytics, the user can also visually inspect the quality and accuracy of these bundle sets to determine which ones are the most reliable to complete the graph.

Through the above interactive modules, we aim to reveal hidden patterns and relationships, with the eventual aim of contributing towards the protection of our oceans while ensuring a sustainable management of the fishing industry.

## 1-1 Fishing Transaction Overview - Country Overview

In **Country Overview**: You can gain a better understanding on the top shipping countries and receiving countries within the fishing industry.

![](images/image3.png)

• Control 1: Use this to configure the desired number of top "X" shipping or receiving countries visualisation output

• Control 2: Use this to customize the colour of the bar charts

## 1-2 Fishing Transaction Overview -- Country Trading Patterns

In **Country Trading Patterns**: You can obtain an overview on the country level trade network and relationships across various years. A deeper understanding of the trade flows can be also obtained by customising the "in" or "out" degree centrality accordingly.

![](images/image4.png)

• Control 1: Use this to configure the desired year in scope

• Control 2: Use this to select either "in" or "out" degree centrality

• Control 3: Use this to customise the degree quantile cut for the countries names to appear. For example, selection of 0.75 will enable countries who are \> 0.75 to have their countries' names displayed in the plot output\

## 1-3 Fishing Transaction Overview - Transaction Structure

In **Transaction Structure**: You can obtain an overall understanding on the data distribution and key statistics (such as median) with the flexibility to select HSCODE and your desired year and variables (for example, Weight (kg), Volume (TEU) etc). You can explore the data distribution via the Packed Bar Chart and Box Plots to identify outlier entities/companies which might be involved in IUU fishing.

![](images/image5.png)

• Control 1: Use this to control which variable you would like to plot against. There are three key variables, namely Weight (kg), Value of Goods (USD) and Volume (TEU). Note that this updates both plots

• Control 2: Use this to configure the HSCODE category for both plots. The options include "Live fish (301)", "Fish, fresh or chilled, whole (302)" and "Fish, frozen, whole (303)" etc.

• Control 3: Use this to configure the desired year in scope. Note that this updates the Packed Bar Chart

• Control 4: Use this to select the top "X" values for the Packed Bar Chart output

• Control 5: Use this to select the specific HSCODE(s) for further investigation via the Box Plot

• Control 6: Use this to customize the colour of the Packed Bar Chart

| In 2030, the highest median "Weight -- KG" is coming from HSCODE 303430.                                                                                                                                     | ![](images/image6.png){width="260"}                            |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Select HSCODE 303430 for further investigation. You can pick more than one HSCODE for multiple comparison.                                                                                                   | ![](images/image7.png)                                         |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Mouseover the Box Plot to gain a better understanding on each individual data point to identify companies who are potential outliers. In this case, Costa de Oro CJSC was identified.                        | ![](images/image8.png)                                         |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| If you wish to investigate other variables, set the variable field to other value (checking Volume Teu), and specify hscode (e.g. 160419), Mar del Este CJSC was found to have super high transaction volume | ![](images/image7.png)![](images/image8.png)                   |

## 1-4 Fishing Transaction Overview -- Temporal Analysis

In **Temporal Analysis**: You can inspect the transaction movement (across various metrics such as Weight (kg), Value of Goods (USD) etc.) across time for specific companies. If there is a sudden variation in the transaction trends, it might be worthy to perform further investigation to potentially identify any suspicious entities.

![](images/image9.png)

• Control 1: Use this to control which variable you would like to plot against. There are three key variables, namely Weight (kg), Value of Goods (USD) and Volume (TEU). Note that this updates both the Bar and Line Chart

• Control 2: Use this to configure the desired Source Company for analysis. Note that this only updates the Bar Chart

• Control 3: Use this to configure the desired HSCODE for further investigation. Note that this only updates the Bar Chart

Example of usage:

By using Control 1, you will identify an abnormally high "Weight (kg)" and "Value of Goods (USD)" during August 2034 and June 2032 respectively. This might be an indicator of IUU fishing companies shutting down as a result of being caught.

![](images/image10.png)

![](images/image11.png)

## 1-5 Fishing Transaction Overview -- Heatmap Activity Overview

In **Heatmap Activity Overview**: You can identify which entities/companies has a higher frequency of transaction. You can also easily pinpoint which are the companies who have sustained activities over a longer time period. At the same time, you can also quickly identify companies with a sudden break in activities, thereby potentially indicating that the company might be involved in IUU Fishing.

![](images/image12.png)

• Control 1: Use this slider to select your desired view on the Top "X" Weights Count

• Control 2: Use this to customise the colour of the Heatmap Plot

Example of usage:

With the Heatmap Plot, you can identify Madhya Pradesh Market LLC as a company that has high network activity during 2030 and 2031, before going silent within the fishing industry. This company might potentially be involved in IUU fishing who closed down as a result of being caught.

![](images/image13.png)

## 2-1 Fishing Transaction Network -- Centrality Plot

In **Centrality Plot**: You can uncover valuable insights on central entities and influential nodes by selecting your desired centrality metrics, (ranging from betweenness centrality, indegree centrality, outdegree centrality, closeness centrality to eigenvalue centrality) to create a network connection map. With the centrality plot visualisation, you can explore the complex network to gain a deeper understanding of the various entities' business relationships within FishEye's knowledge graph.

![](images/image14.png)

• Control 1: This selection affects the node colour. You can select your desired centrality metric and it will automatically segment the data to high/medium/low centrality range. The nodes will be grouped accordingly into 3 different groups of colours

• Control 2: This selection affects the node size. You can configure the node size to your desired centrality metric as well

Example of usage:
