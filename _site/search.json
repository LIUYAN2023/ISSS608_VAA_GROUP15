    "text": "Visual Analytics - Combating Illegal Fishing\nSeafood is the largest traded food commodity, providing sustenance to more than 3 billion people worldwide. However, the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization estimates that 85% of fish stocks are either overfished or fully exploited. Given the reliance on fish supply, transshipment is a crucial component of the global commercial fishing industry. Transshipments at sea helps to increase fishing vessels’ efficiency via eliminating the need to offload their catches at port while reducing overall operating costs. However, it also brings about the issues of enabling fishing vessels to obscure the catches origins which might have been caught illegally.\nIllegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing has been estimated to contribute towards $23.5 billion of losses annually. Aside from negative economic impact, IUU fishing is also a key contributor towards negative social and environmental impact across the world. While research and technology has been leveraged on to aid in the combat against illegal fishing, transshipment activities continue to be a key challenge.\nIn this project, the team sets forth to utilise social network analysis techniques to gain a better understanding of the global fishing activities network to detect vessel relationships and distil key insights from the network graph. To enable individuals and agencies to leverage on the work performed in this study, we will be leveraging on R-Studio and R-Shiny app to publish our analysis and build a user-friendly application for users to gain a better understanding into IUU fishing. The application will have a key focus towards anchoring on enabling a visual analysis into the relationships and temporal trends across entities to enable further investigation into suspicious entities as a first step towards combatting IUU fishing.\nThis Visual Analytics Project is based on VAST Challenge 2022 Mini-Challenge 2\nHope that browsing this web brings you as much joy as we experienced in creating it."

    "text": "Seafood is the largest traded food commodity, providing sustenance to more than 3 billion people worldwide. The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization estimates that 85% of fish stocks are either overfished or fully exploited (World Wildlife Fund, 2023). Given the reliance on fish supply, transshipment is an important part of the global commercial fishing industry.\nIn a study conducted by researchers from City University of New York’s John Jay College of Criminal Justice, it was found that 130 key carriers (approximately 22% of the total involved in the study) conducted 72% of detected “Regional fisheries management organisations” related transshipments. As seen from the image below, these transshipments typically happen across the ocean, with certain areas having a larger share of activity (The Pew Charitable Trusts, 2023).\n\nTransshipment is defined as the practice of larger fishing vessels and those fishing within the high seas offloading their catch to fishing vessels while being resupplied with essentials such as food, water and fuel. Transshipments at sea helps to increase fishing vessels’ efficiency via eliminating the need to offload their catches at port while reducing overall operating costs. However, it also brings about the issues of enabling fishing vessels to obscure the catches origins which might have been caught illegally. (Boerder et al., 2018).\nIllegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is a huge concern as it leads to serious social, economic, and negative environmental impacts (World Ocean Review, 2013). According to a study conducted by the Financial Transparency Coalition, it found that IUU fishing accounts for one-fifth of the global fisheries’ catches (equivalent to approximately $23.5bn) annually. Global losses arising from IUU fishing are also estimated to be approximately $50bn (Collyns, 2022).\n\n\nIllegal fishing tend to happened on the international sea area together with other illegal activities. (Gohar A. Petrossian*, 2022) Research found that illegal fishing activities in the area occurred at three levels, namely illegal fishing in communal networks, illegal fishing in associational networks and illegal fishing in industrial networks. The pattern of illegal fishing occurring in communal networks is done by small fishermen (peasant fisher) with the characteristics of the use of traditional fishing gear, small scale, limited area and relatively subsistence. In an associational network, the pattern of illegal fishing takes place on a wider scale, carried out by a post-peasant fisher with a more modern fishing gear, and involving local apparatus and officials. Meanwhile, illegal fishing in industrial networks is conducted by corporations involving high-ranking officials of policy-making countries at the central level, as well as by industry-scale entrepreneurs and fishermen.\n\n\n\n\nGiven the global social, economic and environmental adverse effects arising from IUU fishing, we seek to gain a better understanding on the network activities of influential and key players, otherwise known as central actors who are involved in transshipment activities. The team look forward towards gaining a better understanding and analysing the key players involved in transshipment activities, as well as the overall network and spatial patterns by leveraging on R Studio and fundamentals of Social Network Analysis.\nIdentification of carrier vessels responsible for transshipment is the first step forward towards offering key insights and opportunities towards improving oversight on illegal fishing. With our insights gained, the team will then put forth recommendations towards how IUU fishing can be better managed and regulated in the longer term."

We could consider analyze the arrivaldate attribute to understand patterns such as seasonality, growth trends, or sporadic activity for each company. Create visualizations such as line charts to show the number of shipments, volume, or value of goods over different time periods (e.g., months, quarters, years) for each company. Group the data by the company’s id and aggregate the shipment counts or other relevant metrics by date.\nRelationship Analysis: This step is to explore relationships between entities (companies) to identify business relationship patterns. Visualize the connections between companies using network graphs or Sankey diagrams, where the nodes represent companies, and the edges represent shipments (frequency, volume, weight, connectivity centrality etc) between them. Analyze the frequency, volume, or value of shipments between different pairs of companies over time to uncover patterns such as preferred trading partners or seasonal variations in trade relationships.We will use R shiny to allow selection and plot the network diagram for specific companies.\nCategorize Business Relationship Patterns: Based on the analysis results, categorize the observed business relationship patterns. For example, there might be patterns like consistent trading partners, sporadic trading, or cyclic trading patterns/ or Transhippment/wholeseller, fishing vessel, buyer. We may perform some clustering using K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering, then indicate these K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering result with colors, annotations, or legends to indicate the different categories of business relationships in the visualizations.
